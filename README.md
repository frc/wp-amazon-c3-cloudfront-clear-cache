## Multiple distributions

If the site is a multisite or has language version-specific domains, you most likely have a distribution for each of them. To define multiple distros, use the format `DISTRIBUTION_ID_[blog id]_[language slug]`

e.g.  
`DISTRIBUTION_ID_1_EN` = multisite, main blog selected, english language  
`DISTRIBUTION_ID_EN` = no multisite, english language  
`DISTRIBUTION_ID_1` = multisite, main blog selected, no language-specific domain
